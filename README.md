### Hi there

I am a full time software developer as well as a self identifying Rustacean, obsessed with text editors(I know... weird), mechanical keyboards, linux and  computers in general!

#### Currently working with but not limited to:
- Rust.
- General Web Stack HTML, CSS, SCSS and PHP.
- The Cesspool that is Javascript/Typescript.
- Emacs and Neovim.
- Occasional Golang.
- Random Bash Scripts that should not see the light of day.
