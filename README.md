I am a full time software developer as well as a self identifying Rustacean, obsessed with text editors(I know... weird), mechanical keyboards, linux and  computers in general!

#### Currently working with but not limited to:
- Rust.
- Golang.
- General Web Stack HTML, CSS and PHP.
- The blackhole that is Javascript/Typescript.
- Random Bash Scripts that should not see the light of day.
